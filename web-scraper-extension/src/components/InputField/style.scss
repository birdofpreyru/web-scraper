// Here we rely on the .input-container style defined in the common.scss
// before this code was written. The clean code style requires to move it
// here, but the way the existing Purchase History Page relies on location
// of .input-container class in the compiled CSS bundle does not allow
// to just move the class without breaking that page and a need for further
// refactoring. Thus, will keep it up there for now.
